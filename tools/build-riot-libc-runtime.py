"""Rebuild libsystem_c (libc) with -O2.

The CMake tree is configured with an empty build type, so the installed
libsystem_c.dylib is clang's -O0 output except for the three string files
libplatform marks optimized. The game imports 122 functions from this library
(stdio, string, stdlib, locale, time) and it is on the path of every frame;
this builder takes each object's own compile command out of the generated
build.make, keeps every define, include and per-file option it has, replaces
the optimization level with -O2 and relinks the result with the configured
link line. -fno-strict-aliasing matches what the existing optimized rebuilds
use for this ten-year-old BSD C.

Files whose correctness depends on frame layout or on running single-threaded
in a forked child keep their configured flags and are listed in EXCLUDED below.
No -DNDEBUG, no -ffast-math, no LTO: only the optimization level changes.
Output: build/riot-libsystem_c.dylib.
